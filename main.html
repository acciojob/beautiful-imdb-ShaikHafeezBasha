	<p class="movieDetail">In the worst case ( when either n or sqrt(n) is prime,
		for example: take n=11 or n=121 for both the cases for
		loop runs sqrt(n) times), the for loop runs for sqrt(n)
		times. The more number of times the while loop iterates
		on a number it reduces the original n, which also reduces
		the value of sqrt(n). Although the best case time complexity
		is O(log(n)), when the prime factors of n is only 2 and 3 or
		n is of the form (2^x*(3^y) where x>=0 and y>=0.</p>
